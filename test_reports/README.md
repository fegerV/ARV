# Test Reports Directory

This directory contains test reports and coverage analysis files.

## Files

- `coverage.xml` - Test coverage report generated by pytest-cov

## Usage

These files are generated automatically by the test suite and provide insights into:
- Code coverage percentages
- Which parts of the codebase are tested
- Test execution results

## Note

These files are regenerated automatically when running tests with coverage enabled. They should not be manually edited.
